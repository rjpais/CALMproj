# Cell Adhesion Logical Modelling (CALM) project 
This project compose my PhD thesis from 2014 to the end of 2017 (work supervised by Doctor Claudine Chaouiya and conducted in instituto  de ciência Gulbenkian in Oeiras, Portugal). During this time I constructed, validated and analysed a logical network model of the regulation of cell adhesion properties during Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.

The project was extended in BioenhancerSystems for refinement and further model analysis towards future medical aplications.  
 
In this repository, I have included: 
  * The network model implemented in GINsim;  
  * The model documentation in XHTML file format
  * The phyton scripts and R code used for model analysis; 
  * A copy of the thesis in pdf (version under revision).
